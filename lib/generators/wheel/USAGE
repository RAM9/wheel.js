Description:
    Install wheel related javascript files into your vendor directory

Example:
    rails generate wheel

    This will create:
        # files that can be easily added to your layout
        vendor/assets/javascripts/wheel/dist

        # source files to make your own custom manifest
        vendor/assets/javascripts/wheel/src

        # vendor files used by wheel.js, all good for building custom manifests
        vendor/assets/javascripts/wheel/vendor

        # a set of recommended manifests that demonstrate the wheel.js load process
        vendor/assets/javascripts/wheel/manifests
