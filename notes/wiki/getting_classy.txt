Getting Classy
===============

- Why object orientation important for easy components


Just Want the class part? Want to expose class on a higher level?

Include wheel.js base file. Expose/export what you want where you want:
  myThing.Class = Wheel.Class; // put it in your namespace
  window.Class = Wheel.Class; // expose it on the window
  this.Class = Wheel.Class; // put it in some context
